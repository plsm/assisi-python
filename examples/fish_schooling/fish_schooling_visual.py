    cover a field of view of 270ยบ.  The image provided by the cameras is
    stored in attributes eye_distance and eye_pixel.  These atributes are
    lists of lenght 2*CAMERA_PIXEL_COUNT.  The data contained in these
    lists is used to compute probability density functions (PD) for basic
    swiming behaviour, wall following behaviour, following other fish, and
    going to spots of interest.  The final discretised PDF is stored in
    attribute pdf_vector, a list of size PDF_VECTOR_SIZE.  A sample angle
    (constrained to the maximum turning angle of fish) is taken which is
    then converted to left and right motor velocities.
